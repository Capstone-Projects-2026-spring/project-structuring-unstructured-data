## Project Abstract

AutoSuggestion Quiz is a web-based educational application that helps students develop critical thinking skills when working with AI-generated code commonly found in modern IDEs. Teachers create and upload quizzes, and students can write and run code directly in the platform while answering by selecting from multiple-choice code suggestions. After submission, teachers can score responses and provide feedback. This format encourages students to question AI-generated code and builds confidence in tackling complex programming problems.

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

The frontend of the application will be developed using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. React will be used to build reusable user interface components and manage application state, while HTML and CSS will be used to structure and style the user interface. The frontend will allow users to select quiz topics, start quizzes, submit answers, and view results in real time.
The backend will be implemented using Python and Django, which will handle user authentication, quiz generation logic, scoring, and data management. The system will store user data, quiz attempts, and performance metrics in a relational database such as SQLite. The backend will also support algorithms that generate or suggest quiz questions based on predefined rules or user interaction history.
The application will be accessible through a standard web browser and designed to support multiple users concurrently, ensuring reliability and responsiveness.

## Background

AutoSuggestion Quiz (ASQ) was created to address the problem of students accepting AI-suggested code without fully understanding it. Many students rely on these suggestions because they are unsure how to approach LeetCode-style questions, which can often be challenging.

ASQ helps solve this issue by presenting students with options for the next line of auto-suggested code. This gives them direction while encouraging them to think critically about how to solve the problem and evaluate AI-generated suggestions. After a code option is selected, an explanation is provided to clarify why the AI suggested that code.

ASQ also supports teachers by allowing them to upload problems and give students opportunities to practice solving challenging coding tasks. In this way, ASQ helps students build confidence, improve problem-solving skills, and develop a deeper understanding of the code they use.

## Required Resources

## First Release

Use this link to access the current version of Autosuggestion Quiz: https://autosuggestions.onrender.com/

Features
  - Teachers can access their dashboard and create problems by providing a problem prompt and boilerplate code for the student to start with
  - Students can access their problems by using the OTP for the assignment (OTP provided by the teacher). NOTE FOR TEACHER: SAVE THE OTP AS SOON AS YOU SEE IT OR YOU WILL HAVE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM
  - Students can attempt a problem and will be prompted with AI suggestions whenever they are inactive for a short period of time.
  - Python is the only language available currently
