## Keywords

Section #, as well as any words that quickly give your peers insights into the application like programming language, development platform, type of application, etc.

## Project Abstract

This project aims to develop a novel application capable of collecting and organizing message data contained in company communication platforms such as Slack. The application will be able to structure any message data across different channels and users into a consistent data model once it is granted proper permissions to access a channel or user direct messaging. The resulting organized data can then be used in multiple workplace tasks such as automating regularly performed actions or summarizing projects for newly onboarded team members.


## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
