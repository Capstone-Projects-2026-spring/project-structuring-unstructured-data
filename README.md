Section #, as well as any words that quickly give your peers insights into the application like programming language, development platform, type of application, etc.

## Project Abstract

This project aims to develop a novel application capable of collecting and organizing message data contained in company communication platforms such as Slack. The application will be able to structure any message data across different channels and users into a consistent data model once it is granted proper permissions to access a channel or user direct messaging. The resulting organized data can then be used in multiple workplace tasks such as automating regularly performed actions or summarizing projects for newly onboarded team members.


## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

Communication platforms like Slack are being increasingly normalized in various workplace environments to discuss projects, schedule meetings, and many other interactions relevant to the specific work the business does. Often, this increased use in messaging applications results in signficant information being buried deep in Slack channel discussions or previous direct messages; the further back a conversation may be, the more context may be necessary for a user to get a proper understanding of the subjects being discussed, making it difficult to fully process information being covered in a conversation's history. Several custom bots and pre-built automation features exist for Slack that can summarize individual messages or perform actions within Slack when an expected message type is sent, but few technologies currently exist that can organize a collection of message data from a conversation into a standardized data model that fully addresses the possible context that can exist and change every time a user sends a new message. By developing a Slack bot with these features in mind, the use cases for structured message data are greatly expanded.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
