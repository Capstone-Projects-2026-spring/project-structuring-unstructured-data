                                Code Battlegrounds is a game where you'll team up with
                                a partner to take on other teams in 2v2 competitive pair 
                                programming. As such, it's important to familiarize yourself 
                                with the roles that each member plays when playing <em>Code Battlegrounds</em>.

                                As the Coder, your job is to write the actual code that will be run and tested.
                                You'll work alongside the Quality Tester to ensure that your code runs without issues 
                                and that it successfully passes the coding challenge. You'll have to work fast though, 
                                as the timer will count down to zero. The better you do, the more points your team will get!

                                As the Quality Tester, your job is to write tests, ensuring the Coder's 
                                code passes all tests and edge cases. You'll be the one hard at work checking for correctness
                                in the code and letting the coder know what went wrong and what to fix or improve. The less errors
                                in your partner's code, the more tests it will pass and the more points you'll both get!

                                Now it's time to get familiar with the environment
                                you'll be working in. The Interface allows you to view the coding
                                challenge, code, and interact with your partner. Let's look at some key features.

                                The Problem Window allows you to view the problem you are 
                                attempting to solve. Here you can see the problem details and the 
                                requirements for the solution.

                                This is where both the Quality Tester and the Coder can see each other's 
                                messages and more effectively communicate with each other.

                                This is where you'll write your code if you're the Coder.
                                The Tester will be able to see the code here.

                                This is the Coder's Dashboard, where the Coder can communicate 
                                with the Quality Tester using quick, predefined messages.

                                This is where you'll write test cases if you're the Quality Tester.
                                Alternatively, you can switch to Terminal view to see the test case output.
