# Version Control

# GitHub:
https://github.com/Capstone-Projects-2026-spring/project-structuring-unstructured-data

# Branching Best Practice:
- Create a new branch off of main (will be Dev in the future) named after the issue being fixed
- If you have access to the Jira board, branches can be created directly from the Jira ticket to ensure consistency in development workflow:

# Pull Requests:
- All PRs MUST be reviewed and approved by another contributor before being merged
- Each PR is templated to give direction to the requester and reviewer
- As of right now local branches will be merged directly into main, however this will change once we setup Production and Development deployments
