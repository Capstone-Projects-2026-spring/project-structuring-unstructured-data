# Version Control

### Overview
Version control is used to manage all source code and documentation changes for the project. A structured version control workflow ensures collaboration, traceability, and consistency across the team.

---

### Repository Management
- The project is hosted in a shared GitHub repository.
- The repository serves as the single source of truth for application code and documentation.
- All team members contribute through the same repository to maintain alignment.

---

### Branching Strategy
- The main branch represents the stable and approved state of the project.
- Feature development and documentation updates are performed on separate branches.
- Branches are named descriptively to reflect the purpose of the change.

---

### Pull Requests and Reviews
- All changes must be submitted through pull requests.
- Pull requests require review and approval by at least one other team member before merging.
- Reviews focus on correctness, clarity, and alignment with project requirements.
- Documentation changes follow the same review process as code changes.

---

### Commit Practices
- Commits should be small, focused, and descriptive.
- Commit messages should clearly summarize the purpose of the change.
- Frequent commits are encouraged to maintain clear change history.

---

### Traceability
- Version control history is used to track changes to requirements, design decisions, and implementation.
- When applicable, commits and pull requests are linked to corresponding Jira issues.
- This linkage helps ensure alignment between requirements, development tasks, and delivered features.

---

### Access Control
- Repository access is restricted to project team members.
- Only authorized contributors may merge changes into the main branch.
- This ensures accountability and protects the integrity of the project.
