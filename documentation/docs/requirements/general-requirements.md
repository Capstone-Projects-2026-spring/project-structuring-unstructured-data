# General Requirements
- Users must have access to a Desktop, laptop, or mobile device. This allows them to send and receive messages that
  can be collected by the system. 
- Users must have internet access. Similar to the point above, users need an internet connection in order to
  send and receive messages online. 
- Users must have an account with the messaging platform (such as Slack or Discord). This allows for
  the system to individually identify who sent a message in the chat.
