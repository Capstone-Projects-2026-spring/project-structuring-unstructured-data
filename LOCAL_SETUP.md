Install the following before continuing:

| Tool | Minimum Version | Download |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | v16+ | https://nodejs.org |
| Python | 3.10+ | https://www.python.org |

You will also need:

- A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account (for the PostgreSQL database and OTP authentication)
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (for AI code suggestions)

> **Windows note:** Use PowerShell or Git Bash for all commands below. Anywhere you see `python3`, use `python` instead on Windows.

## 2. Supabase Setup

ASQ uses Supabase for both its PostgreSQL database and OTP email authentication. All Supabase communication happens on the backend; the frontend requires no Supabase credentials.

### 2.1 Create a Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in.
2. Click **New project**, choose an organization, and give the project a name (e.g., `asq-local`).
3. Set a strong **database password** and save it. You will need it for the connection string.
4. Wait for the project to finish provisioning (approximately one minute).

### 2.2 Collect Your Credentials

**Project URL and anon key:**

Go to **Project Settings → API** and copy:
- The **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
- The **anon / public** key

**Database connection string:**

Go to **Project Settings → Database → Connection string → URI**.
Select the **Session pooler** tab (port `5432`). The URI looks like:

```
postgresql://postgres.[project-ref]:[password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```

Replace `[password]` with the database password you set in step 2.1.

### 2.3 Create the Schema

Open the **SQL Editor** in the Supabase dashboard and run the following SQL in full. This creates every table the application depends on.

```sql
-- Teachers
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS teachers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Problems
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS problems (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    teacher_id INTEGER REFERENCES teachers(id),
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    access_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    boilerplate TEXT DEFAULT '',
    language TEXT DEFAULT 'python',
    languages TEXT DEFAULT '["python"]',
    time_limit_minutes INTEGER,
    max_attempts INTEGER,
    allow_copy_paste BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    track_tab_switching BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Sections (ordered blocks within a problem)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sections (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    problem_id INTEGER REFERENCES problems(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    order_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
    label TEXT NOT NULL,
    code TEXT DEFAULT '{}'
);

-- Suggestions for a section (correct or distractor)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS suggestions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    section_id INTEGER REFERENCES sections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    source TEXT DEFAULT 'ai'
);

-- Test cases for a problem
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_cases (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    problem_id INTEGER REFERENCES problems(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    input TEXT DEFAULT '',
    expected TEXT DEFAULT '',
    explanation TEXT DEFAULT ''
);

-- Student sessions (in-progress and submitted)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    problem_id INTEGER REFERENCES problems(id),
    student_name TEXT,
    code TEXT,
    suggestion_log TEXT DEFAULT '[]',
    tab_switch_log TEXT DEFAULT '[]',
    test_results TEXT DEFAULT '[]',
    score INTEGER,
    total INTEGER,
    started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

> You do not need to run any migration scripts from the source code. The schema is managed entirely through the Supabase SQL editor.

### 2.4 Configure OTP Authentication (Optional for Dev)

> **Having auth issues or just want to skip email setup?** You can log in without any OTP email by entering `dev` as the email address on the login page. See [Section 7](#7-dev-login-bypass-no-otp-email-needed) for full details.

If you want real OTP emails to work rather than using the dev bypass (see Section 7):

1. In the Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication → Providers → Email**.
2. Confirm **Enable Email Provider** is turned on.
3. Set **Confirm email** to **off**. Otherwise, first-time OTP sign-ups require an extra confirmation step that breaks the login flow.
4. Under **Authentication → URL Configuration**, set **Site URL** to `http://localhost:3000`.

## 3. Backend Setup

### 3.1 Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps ASQ's Python dependencies isolated from your system Python installation. It is strongly recommended, and essential if you have other Python projects on the same machine.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Your terminal prompt will show `(venv)` when the environment is active. Run `deactivate` at any time to exit it. All subsequent backend commands assume the venv is active.

### 3.2 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fastapi` | Web framework |
| `uvicorn` | ASGI server |
| `psycopg2-binary` | PostgreSQL driver (connects to Supabase) |
| `python-dotenv` | Loads the `.env` file |
| `openai` | OpenAI API client for AI suggestions |
| `pyjwt` | JWT creation and validation |
| `httpx` | Async HTTP client |
| `pytest` / `pytest-cov` | Test runner and coverage reporting |

> **macOS note:** `psycopg2-binary` is self-contained and does not require a separate PostgreSQL installation. If you see a build error, confirm you are installing from `requirements.txt` as-is.

### 3.3 Configure Environment Variables

From inside the `backend/` directory, copy the example file:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Open `backend/.env` and fill in your values:

```env
# Supabase PostgreSQL connection string (Session pooler URI, port 5432)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.[ref]:[password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres

# Supabase project URL and anon key (from Project Settings → API)
SUPABASE_URL=https://[your-project-ref].supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-anon-public-key

# JWT signing secret (any long random string is fine for local development)
SECRET_KEY=change-me-in-production

# Set to True to enable the dev login bypass endpoint
DEBUG=True

# Your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | **Yes** | Supabase Session pooler URI |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | **Yes** | Required for OTP authentication |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | **Yes** | Supabase anon / public key |
| `SECRET_KEY` | **Yes** | Any random string works locally |
| `DEBUG` | No | Set `True` to enable dev login |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | **Yes** | Required for AI suggestions |

---

## 4. Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal** (keep the backend terminal running separately).

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

This installs React, the Monaco editor component, and all testing libraries declared in `package.json`. It may take a minute on first run.

**Optional: Custom backend port**

If you changed the backend to a port other than `8000`, create `frontend/.env` and add:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:<your_port>
```

No frontend `.env` file is needed if you are using the default port `8000`.

---

## 5. Running the Application

You need two terminals running simultaneously: one for the backend, one for the frontend.

### Terminal 1: Backend

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API starts at **http://localhost:8000**.

On first startup, the server automatically seeds the database with a default teacher account and sample problem, but only if the `teachers` table is empty. The seed data is:

- Teacher email: `seed@autoquiz.dev`
- Sample problem access code: `123456`

You can browse the interactive API documentation at **http://localhost:8000/docs**.

### Terminal 2: Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The app opens automatically at **http://localhost:3000**.

## 6. Running Tests

### 6.1 Backend Tests

The backend test suite lives in `backend/backUnitTest/` and is divided into three groups:

| Suite | Location | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| AI tests | `backUnitTest/backAiTest/` | AI suggestion generation, response format, token handling |
| Auth tests | `backUnitTest/backAuthTest/` | Auth routes, login, and registration |
| Login tests | `backUnitTest/backLoginTest/` | Login flow end-to-end |

**You must run pytest from the project root**, not from inside `backend/`. The `PYTHONPATH` must be set to the root so that inter-module imports resolve correctly.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
# From the project root directory (project-auto-suggestion-quiz/)
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m pytest backend/backUnitTest/ -v
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# From the project root directory (project-auto-suggestion-quiz/)
$env:PYTHONPATH="."
python -m pytest backend/backUnitTest/ -v
```

> **Note:** Running `pytest` from inside `backend/` without setting `PYTHONPATH` will cause `ModuleNotFoundError`. Always run from the project root as shown above.

**Generate an HTML coverage report:**

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the project root
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m pytest backend/backUnitTest/ -v --cov=backend --cov-report=html
```

The report is written to `htmlcov/index.html`. Open that file in a browser to see line-by-line coverage across all backend modules.

### 6.2 Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

Jest starts in interactive watch mode. Press `a` to run all tests, or `q` to quit.

The test suite uses **React Testing Library** (`@testing-library/react`) and **jest-dom** (`@testing-library/jest-dom`), both already installed by `npm install`.

**Run tests once, non-interactively** (useful for CI or peer review):

```bash
cd frontend
CI=true npm test
```

## 7. Dev Login Bypass (No OTP Email Needed)

If you do not have a working Supabase SMTP setup, you can still sign in as the seed teacher without receiving an OTP email.

1. Make sure `DEBUG=True` is set in `backend/.env`.
2. Start the backend and frontend as described in Section 5.
3. On the login page, enter `dev` as the email address.
4. Click **Send OTP**. No email is sent and no Supabase call is made.
5. You are signed in immediately as `seed@autoquiz.dev`.

> This endpoint (`/auth/dev-login`) is completely disabled when `DEBUG` is `False` or not set. Never enable it in a production deployment.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

**`psycopg2` connection error on startup**

Verify that `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` is the Session pooler URI (port `5432`) with the correct password filled in. Do not use the "Direct connection" URI; it uses a different hostname format and may not be reachable from all networks.

**`ModuleNotFoundError` when running pytest**

You are running pytest from inside `backend/` without `PYTHONPATH` set. Run from the project root with `PYTHONPATH=.` as shown in Section 6.1.

**OTP emails are not arriving**

Use the dev login bypass (Section 7) during development to avoid waiting on email delivery.

**`npm install` fails with node-gyp errors**

Confirm you are on Node.js v16 or later (`node --version`). On macOS, Xcode Command Line Tools may be required:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Frontend cannot reach the backend**

Confirm the backend is running. `http://localhost:8000/docs` should load. If you changed the backend port, set `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `frontend/.env` as described in Section 4.

**Seed data does not appear after first startup**

The seed runs only once, when the `teachers` table is empty. If you started the server before the schema was created, drop and recreate the tables using the SQL in Section 2.3, then restart the server.
