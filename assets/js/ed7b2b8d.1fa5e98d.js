The tool's backend also will have the ability to extract context and structure data into meaningful units, accomplished through a custom built LLM or similar NLP model designed for organizing data based on learned language patterns. The tools used to implement this may shift as the project scope is fully defined, but possible services include the LangChain framework for Python or JavaScript or the LangExtract Python library.
