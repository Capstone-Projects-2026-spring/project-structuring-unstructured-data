Often, this increased use in messaging applications results in signficant information being buried deep in Slack channel discussions or previous direct messages; the further back a conversation may be, the more context may be necessary for a user to get a proper understanding of the subjects being discussed, making it difficult to fully process information being covered in a conversation's history. Several custom bots and pre-built automation features exist for Slack that can summarize individual messages or perform actions within Slack when an expected message type is sent, but few technologies currently exist that can organize a collection of message data from a conversation into a standardized data model that fully addresses the possible context that can exist and change every time a user sends a new message. By developing a Slack bot with these features in mind, the use cases for structured message data are greatly expanded."})]})}function l(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}}}]);
