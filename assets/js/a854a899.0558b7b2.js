The tool operates within Slack's interface through a bot or similar automation, meaning that users will adjust the application's settings or control whether they consent to their messages being collected through the application directly. When a user begins a DM or enters a conversation where the bot is configured, the user is prompted to give permission for all message data to be collected (either via an opt-in or hybrid approval). If active, the tool marks whenever a new message within the DM or conversation has been stored in memory for contextualization. When the user wishes to retrieve their structured message data, they can prompt the tool within Slack, which will result in the application displaying a basic data model of all included messages in a digestable format, which can be directly downloaded or accessed for the use of context-based automation at a larger scale, such as for summarizing entire channel's worth of information."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"conceptual-design",children:"Conceptual Design"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"For the scope of our project, our application's design will utilize the Slack API to access all user, message, and channel data, but development of a codebase compatible with multiple communication platforms is anticipated. For the best compatibility with the existing Web API that communication platforms generally provide, the application will integrate with the target platform using routes composed in JavaScript and Node.js; this version of the app specifically will leverege the Bolt for JavaScript open-source framework in the backend designed directly for Slack, allowing both the access of Slack data and interaction with Slack's UI. The tool's backend also will have the ability to extract context and structure data into meaningful units, accomplished through a custom built LLM or similar NLP model designed for organizing data based on learned language patterns. The tools used to implement this may shift as the project scope is fully defined, but possible services include the LangChain framework for Python or JavaScript or the LangExtract Python library.

Often, this increased use in messaging applications results in signficant information being buried deep in Slack channel discussions or previous direct messages; the further back a conversation may be, the more context may be necessary for a user to get a proper understanding of the subjects being discussed, making it difficult to fully process information being covered in a conversation's history. Several custom bots and pre-built automation features exist for Slack that can summarize individual messages or perform actions within Slack when an expected message type is sent, but few technologies currently exist that can organize a collection of message data from a conversation into a standardized data model that fully addresses the possible context that can exist and change every time a user sends a new message. By developing a Slack bot with these features in mind, the use cases for structured message data are greatly expanded."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
